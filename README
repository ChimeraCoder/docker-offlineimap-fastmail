# Offlineimap-Fastmail

This is a docker container for running offlineimap with a Fastmail email address



#### Usage

````
$ docker run -e EMAIL=$EMAIL -e PASSWORD=$PASSWORD -v ~/mail:/home/offlineimap/mail/ offlineimap-fastmail
````

This assumes `~/mail` exists and is writable by the user with uid `1000`; any directory with correct permissions can be used.

#### systemd service

An example systemd unit file has also been included in the repository for convenience. If using the provided file, make sure to define the `EMAIL`, `PASSWORD`, and `USERNAME` environment variables in `/etc/sysconfig/offlineimap-fastmail`. (`USERNAME` refers to your username on the host machine)

````sh
EMAIL=username@example.com
PASSWORD=hunter2
USERNAME=myusername
````

You may also want to use the included systemd timer to schedule periodic polling.
